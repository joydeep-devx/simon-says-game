# simon-says-game-
A simple Simon Says memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a random color sequence that the player must repeat correctly. With each level, the sequence grows longer, making the game more challenging and fun.  This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic using JavaScript.
